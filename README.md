DEMO:

Here are two example runs of the robot scoring a goal. The robot starts and ends in slightly different positions in the two runs, and successfully stops at the goal in both runs (without using any LiDAR information or teleoping!). You can also notice that the terminal window on the laptop in the videos is populating with the linear and angular speeds that are predicted by our model (and sent as cmd_vel messages to the robot) at each timestep when the robot receives a picture. We have also included a picture of what that terminal output looks like. Note that the videos are sped up to 2x speed.
